# Printerface
Interface for getting information from Octoprint to Godot
This is a Godot-Mono Game. You can open it using the Godot Mono builds or Godot 3.1 later this year. also you can open the sln file with Monodevelop or any other C# API.
The OctoprintConnection.cs File should provide an Interface for The Engine to read from Octoprint. this can be plugged into any other Game like seen in this Godot example.
